# Rainfall_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning
The project is about Rainfall prediction using Machine Learning models. We've used Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, SVM and Random Forest. We evaluated the models using MSE, MAE, RMSE and R2 scores. We've Integrated the model with the gradio in-built API.
